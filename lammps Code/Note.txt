The file mainly consists of four parts.
LAMMPS input file : in.lammps
A module for inserting carbon atoms and assigning them an initial temperature:add_one_C.in
Atomic coordinate file : lammps.data
Potential file : NiCH.ff
The potential file was obtained from Mueller(https://doi.org/10.1021/jp9035056)
During the later simulations, the whole system was shifted every 100 steps so that the Ni particle’s center of mass remained at the origin for easier data analysis.
In the early tests, no such shift was applied and all atoms moved freely.
The code is run on the HPC facilities at Southeast University, using version of LAMMPS 2Aug2023.
